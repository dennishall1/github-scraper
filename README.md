# github-scraper

## Getting Started & Running the Scraper

1. Pull down the code (or just download the code as a zip, github provides that link on the right).
1. Create a file named `.env` at the project root (in the same folder as `package.json`) -- The contents of this file should be

    ````
    gh_username = YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME
    gh_password = YOUR-GITHUB-PASSWORD
    ````
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `node app`
1. Point your browser to `http://localhost:3000/8` - where the `8` at the end indicates the Sprint # (a.k.a., Milestone)
